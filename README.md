# Tag-It

Tag-It is a CI and CLI tool to bump semver versions.

## Why?

There are many solutions to this problem, so yet another tool for the job?

Tag-It's goal is to provide Semver bumping and utilities to any platform, weather the command line, or your CI Pipeline. This project was created for use in Woodpecker CI as there are no (to my knowledge) workflows for bumping Semver versions.
